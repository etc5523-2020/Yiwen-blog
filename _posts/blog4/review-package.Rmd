# Introduction

The package I reviewed is named "covid19usa", which is created by Brendi Ang. The goal of the "covid19usa" package is to provide an embedded interactive R Shiny web application for key data visualization of Covid-19 cases and testing efficiency across the U.S states. 

And it contains two main functions, which are refactored from user-interface and sever-side logic of the shiny app embedded inside the package:

- ui_input() : Creates reactive input for Shiny app.
- us_pop_ests : Provides the dataset for the estimated population by U.S county, primarily used for relational joins.

What's more, it also provides the relevant datasets to run this shiny app and for further use. One is the dataset for the Confirmed Covid-19 Cases and Deaths by States in the U.S, reported by The New York Times, from 2020-01-22 to 2020-10-07. Another one is the US map data for states.
