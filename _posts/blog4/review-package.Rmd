# Introduction

The package I reviewed is named "covid19usa", which is created by Brendi Ang. The goal of the "covid19usa" package is to provide an embedded interactive R Shiny web application for key data visualization of Covid-19 cases and testing efficiency across the U.S states. 

And it contains two main functions, which are refactored from user-interface and sever-side logic of the shiny app embedded inside the package:

- ui_input() : Creates reactive input for Shiny app.
- us_pop_ests : Provides the dataset for the estimated population by U.S county, primarily used for relational joins.

What's more, it also provides the relevant datasets to run this shiny app and for further use. One is the dataset for the Confirmed Covid-19 Cases and Deaths by States in the U.S, reported by The New York Times, from 2020-01-22 to 2020-10-07. Another one is the US map data for states.

# What I expect

On the first I look into this package, I thought it should first provide the shiny app on COVID-19, then relevant datasets to run the app and the functions that can be used in a further stage smoothly. Also, I expect there will be a detailed instruction and the documentation inside both package and shiny app will be logical and concise enough, so I can have a smoother experience on referring this package.

When I actually reviewing this package, I found it an excellent package with complete structure and clear logic. It did most of what I expected. I can get th data easily, run the function smoothly, and most importantly, the shiny app, can be launched up successfully. 

When exploring the shiny app, I found the UI interface is quite visual appealing, which brings me a good experience. And I can get to know the COVID-19 condition of USA easily by controlling the input of date and state. And the "About" page is also very fluent and clear, from which I can quickly get to know the motivation and the creator of this app.
